title: Switch to Supabase
description: How to change the database provider to Supabase.
---

[Supabase](https://supabase.com) is an open source Firebase alternative providing a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, and Storage.

`next-forge` uses Neon as the database provider with Prisma as the ORM as well as Clerk for authentication. This guide will provide the steps you need to switch the database provider from Neon to Supabase. This guide is based on a few existing resources, including [Supabase's guide](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/prisma) and [Prisma's guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/supabase).

<Note>
 For authentication, another guide will be provided to switch to Supabase Auth with feature parity to Clerk like organization management, user roles, and more (coming soon).
</Note>

Here's how to switch from Neon to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for your `next-forge` project.

## 1. Sign up to Supabase

Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). You can manage your projects through the Dashboard or use the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development).

_We'll be using both the Dashboard and CLI throughout this guide._

## 2. Create a Project

Create a new project from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard). Give it a name and choose your preferred region. Once created, you'll get access to your project's connection details. Head to the **Settings** page, then click on **Database**.

We'll need to keep track of the following for the next step:

- The Database URL in `Transaction` mode, with the port ending in `6543`. We'll call this `DATABASE_URL`.
- The Database URL in `Session` mode, with the port ending in `5432`. We'll call this `DIRECT_URL`.

## 3. Update the environment variables

Update the `.env` file with the Supabase connection details. Make sure you add `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1` to the end of the `DATABASE_URL` value. 

```js .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
DIRECT_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres"
```

<Note>
`pgbouncer=true` disables Prisma from generating prepared statements. This is required since our connection pooler does not support prepared statements in transaction mode yet. The `connection_limit=1` parameter is only required if you are using Prisma from a serverless environment.
</Note>

## 4. Replace the dependencies

Prisma doesn't have a Supabase adapter yet, so we just need to remove the Neon adapter and connect to Supabase directly.

First, remove the Neon dependencies from the project...

```sh Terminal
pnpm remove @neondatabase/serverless @prisma/adapter-neon ws @types/ws --filter @repo/database
```

... and add the Supabase dependencies:

```sh Terminal
pnpm install -D supabase --filter @repo/database
```

## 5. Update the database package

Update the `database` package. We'll remove the Neon extensions and connect to Supabase directly, which should automatically use the environment variables we set earlier.

```ts packages/database/index.ts
import 'server-only';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

export const database = new PrismaClient();

export * from '@prisma/client';
```

## 6. Update the Prisma schema

Update the `prisma/schema.prisma` file so it contains the `DIRECT_URL`. This allows us to use the Prisma CLI to perform other actions on our database (e.g. migrations) by bypassing Supavisor.

```js prisma/schema.prisma {4}
datasource db {
  provider     = "postgresql"
  url          = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl    = env("DIRECT_URL")
  relationMode = "prisma"
}
```

Now you can run the migration from the root of your `next-forge` project:

```sh Terminal
pnpm run migrate
```

## 7. Setting up Supabase Auth

After setting up your database connection, you'll need to configure Supabase Auth. This section covers integrating the authentication system while maintaining your existing application structure.

### 7.1 Environment Variables

Add the following Supabase Auth environment variables to your `.env` files:

```js .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-project-url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
```

You can find these values in your Supabase project dashboard under Project Settings > API.

### 7.2 Install the Supabase Auth Package

The project includes a pre-configured `@repo/supabase` package that handles authentication. Install it in your applications:

```sh Terminal
pnpm install @repo/supabase --filter @repo/app --filter @repo/web --filter @repo/api
```

### 7.3 User Data Structure

Supabase Auth provides a default user schema with the following key fields:
- `id`: The user's unique identifier
- `email`: The user's email address
- `created_at`: Timestamp of user creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update

Example of accessing user data in server components:

```ts
import { getSupabaseServerClient } from '@repo/supabase/server';

const supabase = getSupabaseServerClient();
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
const user = session?.user;
```

For client components:

```ts
import { getSupabaseClient } from '@repo/supabase/client';

const supabase = getSupabaseClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
```

### 7.4 User Management

The `@repo/supabase` package provides several utility functions for user management:

```ts
// Sign in
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});

// Sign up
await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});

// Sign out
await supabase.auth.signOut();
```

### 7.5 Protected Routes

Protect your routes using the middleware provided by `@repo/supabase`:

```ts middleware.ts
import { createMiddlewareClient } from '@repo/supabase/middleware';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const res = NextResponse.next();
  const supabase = createMiddlewareClient(req, res);
  await supabase.auth.getSession();
  return res;
}
```

### 7.6 Admin Functions

For admin operations like fetching user details, use the admin client:

```ts
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.admin.getUserById(userId);
```

<Note>
Remember that admin functions require the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and should only be used in secure server contexts.
</Note>

### 7.7 Next Steps

After completing the auth setup:
1. Update your sign-in and sign-up pages to use Supabase Auth
2. Migrate any user metadata to Supabase's user management system
3. Update your application's user context providers
4. Test the authentication flow end-to-end

For more advanced features like organization management and user roles, refer to the Supabase documentation on [Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) and [Policies](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security/policies).
